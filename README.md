# README

This Script is Completly Free to use and i enjoy doing Scripts which are free for everyone. Join my discord to suggest new Scripts
which i should develop! This Script is ONLY Working on ESX with MySQL i will be adding QB Support maybe in the Future.

Everythink is Defined in Config wich you may want to change. Its currently mostly on German, so you have to translate the files
in client-, server- and functions files/folders.

# ADD NEW CELLS

- first DEFINE A New cell like `cell6` in the Config with Coords.
- IN client.lua:143 add a new line

`elseif cell == 'cell6' then [..]`
